Title: "That Day"

[Armin monologues the introduction to the episode, while historic drawings of the War with Titans are shown.]

EREN: Over a century ago, beings that prey on humans suddenly appeared. Their absolutely overwhelming strength quickly pushed humanity to the brink of extinction [Wall Maria is shown with Titans on, displayed in red on its outskirts.] The surviving humans constructed three walls: Maria, Rose, and Sina, which brought them a century of peace.

[The episode begins with a mouse running from behind a rock. There’s blood splatter on the land behind it. To the right of the rock is a lain arm with the palm face up. Looks remarkably similar to Eren’s mother. A leg is shown further to the right as a crow flies down to pick away at the leftover limb. A small fire burns in the distance. The view switches to a slightly frontal view of the crow. There’s a torn up building behind him. The crow picks its head up with little lines of blood across it’s face and bird calls. The rest of the village is shown in silence with damaged roofs and smoke coming from a variety of houses.]

WALL WORSHIPPER: [Preaches out loud as screams can be heard throughout the village] Till that time I had been a wretched soul, and wholly giv’n to greed! [A Titan with low-cut brown hair is shown walking.] Now, as thou see’st, I’m punished for it here! [More Titans are shown traversing the village. A little girl is shown hiding in the darkness of her house. The Wall Worshipper is walking in the opposite direction of the citizens running.] What Avarice doth is here made manifest in this purgation of converted souls.[A mass of Titans are still coming through the gate.] Nor bath this Mount a penalty more bitter!

[A brown-haired lady a pink dress, with a white blouse under, runs into a dead end. Breathing-hard, she holds her mouth to keep quiet, with her back against the wall. A large shadow comes over her. She looks up, and a Titan has spotted her from above the roof. He grabs her by the head and she screams]

LADY: [Shoe fall to the ground] Let me go!

WALL WORSHIPPER: O Avarice! [Citizens are displayed running in panic, away from the breached wall, yelling and screaming.] Thou hast to thyself so drawn my race, [Titan are quickly snatching up a citizens] that ev’n for its own flesh it careth not! What more canst thou do with us? [The worshipper continues to walk with a stick in his hand, preaching. He stops in awe and looks to his left. A Titan with short brown hair stares at him. grabs the worshipper and devours him]. O Avarice! Thou hast to thyself…[The worshipper’s book falls in a small puddle of blood]

[We are reverted back to the end of the previous episode, with Eren over Hannes’s left shoulder and Mikasa under his right arm, running away. Eren comes to alive and punches Hannes in the back of the head.]

HANNES: Eren! What are you doing?!

EREN: We were so close to saving Mom! Why couldn’t you mind your own business?! [Elbows Hannes in the top of his head.] We were so close to saving her!

HANNES: Knock it off, dammit! [Throws Eren off of his shoulder straight into the pavement.]

MIKASA: Eren! [Maneuvers her way out from under Hannes arm and runs towards Eren and kneels beside him.]


HANNES: Eren. [Walks toward them.] You couldn’t save your mother because you lacked the strength. [Eren’s face is filled with anger as he begins to tear up. He tries to punch Hannes in the face, but Hannes catches his arm.] And I…[Eren continues to try and force his fist into Hannes.] I couldn’t stand up to the Titan…[Hannes breaks out crying and Eren stops, with tears still coming from his eyes.] because I lacked the courage! [Takes Eren and Mikasa by the hand and continues on] I’m sorry.

[Mikasa holds her head as she flashbacks about the recent Titan invasion. She looks behind her.]

MIKASA: It’s happened again..

[The focus switches to the wall and then a Titan capturing another citizen to eat.]

SOLDIER: Hurry! To the inner gate! Escape aboard the boats there! Hurry Before you get eaten!

[Citizens on the docks trying to board the boats are seen. Some of the boats begin to take off. Eren begins to narrate.]

EREN: City districts like Shiganshina that stick out in vital spots along the wall serve to attract the Titans and streamline security costs and troop numbers. Performing true to its role as a Titan target. Shiganshina had but one inner gate through which it’s citizens could flee.

[A bag is thrown off the bridge.]

SOLDIER: Discard your belongings! Let as many people on as possible!

[ArmIn is shown looking off the boat, waiting for something. He looks around and breathes deeply.]

ARMIN’S GRANDFATHER: Sit, Armin.

ARMIN: But Eren and Mikasa still aren’t here. There they are! [Armin notices the devastated look on Eren’s face as he sees his two friends about to board.]

ARMIN’S GRANDFATHER: Just let them be for now. The poor thing! How very traumatized he must be…


ARMIN: Huh?

[Scene switches to a soldier being shown with cannons behind him.]

SOLDIER: What are you dawdling for?! Hurry the hell up! Get those cannons loaded! [A Titan appears in the distance.] Hurry! They’re closing in! The cannons are moved up slightly while citizens’ continue to run to safety past the soldiers. [Hannes breathes heavily and then runs off. ]

CITIZENS: [On the boat] This can’t be for real...Please, God...Please. God...Please God…

[The soldiers lift up the ramp to the boat as others block the citizens off]

CITIZENS: [Off the boat: man] Hey! What are you doing!

SOLDIER: It’s at full capacity! It has to leave!

CITIZENS: [Off the boat: woman] No! Please! At least let our children on!

SOLDIER: I’m sorry but we can’t! Get going!

CITIZENS: Let us on! Let us on!

People began to take desperate leaps towards the boat. One man catches the edge, the other falls into the river. The cannons can be heard over the wall. The scene switches to show what's happening in front of the escape route gate.Dialogue between many soldiers commence.
SOLDIER: You idiot! What are you aiming at?!

SOLDIER: B-But, Sir, these aren’t accurate enough to aim with!

SOLIDER: I don’t give a crap! Get’em reloaded at once!
SOLDIER: It’s no use!

[The wall gate is being lowered.]

SOLDIER: The gate’s closing…!

SOLDIER: Retreat! we’re gonna get left behind!

SOLDIER: Hey!

[Soldiers are shown closing the gate from the inside.]

HANNES: Don’t shut it! Hold on a little longer! There are still lots of people in there!

SOLDIER: If the Titans get through, the town being overrun will be the least of our worries. All of humankind will be forced to withdraw behind the next wall!

HANNES: But that’s no reason to leave these people to die!

[Two soldiers appear quickly behind Hannes, tired.]

SOLDIERS: Shut it! Hurry! The Titans are coming!

SOLDIER: Close the gate at once! [The gate closes further.]

HANNES: Stop! [He’s grabbed by the two soldiers.]

[A large sound is heard in the distance, forcing everyone to stop and Eren to look up, but only listen, in terror. A large, yet very distinct Titan appears, fairly muscular and built, short-white hair, and a height about 15M-17M. He faces the closing gate. The soldiers back away as they stare, scared to move. The titan takes a stance and begins running toward the gate at full speed.]

SOLDIER: What the…? It’s…! Fire!

[The cannonballs that hit, don’t even penetrate or leave a mark on his armored body.]

SOLDIER: What?!

SOLDIER: No effect?!

[[So much power comes from the Armored Titan’s velocity, that the pressure in the air lifts a 5M class Titan off its feet.]

SOLDIER: It’s…! It’s coming! Retreat! [The soldiers turn and run.] A Titan’s coming! It’s charging this way! Hurry! Shut the gate!

[Armor Titan tears through houses and bum rushes the gate with his shoulder. Lifting many soldiers high into the air and a big opening for Titans to completely take over Shiganshina. Soldiers are scared stiff as they look upon what just happend.]

SOLDIER: The gate…

[Armor Titan breathes deep and lets fire out of his mouth. Eren and the others witness this from their boat.]

ARMIN: [Narrating while the devastating aftermath of the invasion is shown.] Within hours of the fall of Shiganshina on the south side of Wall Maria, news of the incident had reached every city inside human territory.

[The setting is now, the south side of Wall Rose in the Trost District. Men converse at table about the news of Shiganshina.]

MAN 1: Is it true the Titans have overrun Shiganshina?! I can’t believe this?! The walls have held strong for a century! Why now?! Whether we believe it or not. The fact is that refugees have fled here by boat!

MAN 2: Reports say there are five hundred on board.

MAN 3: The question is if Shiganshina is all that was affected…

MAN 4: But surely they couldn’t have gotten through the Wall Maria as well?

MAN 3: In any event, we must contact the central government and request instructions. This crisis is far too much for us to handle on our own.

[A soldier barges in.]

SOLDIER: I’m sorry to interrupt! A courier horse has just arrived! Titans have breached Wall Maria and entered it’s interior

[A large amount of Titans are shown on the inside of Wall Maria, with HANNES on top of a roof, looking extremely frightened]

HANNES: It’s over...It’s all over…

Switches to the people on the boat, with Eren’s eyes wide open in despair.

CHILD: The Titans are going to devour humanity again....This is the end.

[Eren is having flashbacks of his last time with his family, witnessed in the previous episode.]

EREN: I’ll...never see that house...ever again…[He begins to cry.] Why?! [Flashbacks continue.] Why’d I argue for no reason like that?! Why was that all I could do?! And now mom’s gone! She’s never coming back! Why…?! [Flashback of Hannes telling Eren “because he lacked the strength.”] It’s because I’m weak...Because humans are weak...Is crying the only thing the weak can do?! [He looks at the bruised right palm as a tear drops from his face into its center. His eyes change and he clenches it into a fist. Stands up and walks to the side of the boat. Mikasa watches.] I’m...going to…

MIKASA: Eren.

ARMIN: [Grabs Eren by the shoulder.] What’s gotten into you. Eren? [Eren shoves him off.] Eren...

EREN:[Slamming his hands on the portside of the boat while still crying.] ...drive them out! [Armin is surprised.] I’m going to drive out...every last one from this world!

ARMIN: Eren…[The scene switches and Armin narrates] The same year, the central government made the decision to withdraw all of humanity’s domain behind Wall Rose. An estimated 10,000 people were eaten by Titans during this time.

[Eren’s father is shown on his way back from his trip riding a courier]

GRISHA: Eren...Karula...Mikasa...Please be alright! [He begins to cry and a flashback commences. A flame is shown with a black background.] Eren! Eren! Eren! Eren!

EREN: Dad! Stop, Dad! [Grisha is shown with a needle in his hand holding Eren down.] What are you trying to do?! [Flame with the black background is shown again.]

GRISHA: Just give me your arm!

EREN: Mom’s death has made you go crazy! [The flame disappears and a key is shown spinning in it’s place.] Let go, Dad!

GRISHA: It’s for...your own sake! [Injects him.]

EREN: What are you talking about?! [He screams and grabs the earth.]

GRISHA: Listen! Don’t forget the key! You must reach it! Until… you learn… the truth someday…!

[Key falls to the ground and Eren wakes up from his nightmare to the sound of bells, in the warehouse of a building.]

MIKASA: Eren. Are you okay? You were having a nightmare.

EREN: [Grabs his head] I feel like I just saw Dad…

MIKASA: No. You were dreaming. [She looks around.]

EREN: Oh…[Takes his hand from his head and realizes he’s wearing a necklace with a key around his neck.]

MIKASA: Let’s go. [Stands up.] They said they’re going to hand out food. [Eren tucks the key inside his shirt, gets up and begins to walk outside of the building.]
Apparently this was their food storehouse. They gathered all the boat refugees here. [Eren creates a visor with his hand and is surprised. Soldiers hand out food.]

CITIZEN: Hey! Get in line, will ya?!

CITIZEN 2: Shut Up! [They begin fighting.] I ain’t eaten anything since last night!

MIKASA: We can’t say we’ve survived just yet.

ARMIN: Eren! Mikasa!

EREN: Armin…

ARMIN: Here! Just in time! My grandpa got us some by saying it was for children!

MIKASA: Thank You.

[A soldier looks at them in disgust.]

EREN: What’s his problem?

ARMIN: You can’t blame him. There’s probably not enough food to go around. And that’s an entire day’s worth. There are just too many refugees. There was already a food shortage going on, plus the people here aren’t treated as well as citizens on the outer wall.

[Citizens arguing *This is mine!*, *Shut up!**]

SOLDIER: Why should we hafta give our food to some lousy outsiders? If they Titans got through the wall, they could’ve at least eaten some more people, if you ask me!
[Eren, in anger, walks towards the soldier.]

ARMIN: Eren!

SOLDIER: This is just gonna make the good shortage even worse. [Eren kicks him in the shin.]
Oww! [He punches Eren in the face. Eren holds his ground.] What the hell?! You damn kid! [Another soldier kicks Eren down.]

EREN: You don’t know what it’s like! You’ve never seen it! You’ve never seen what the Titans do to people!

SOLDIER: [Walking towards Eren] Shut Up!

ARMIN: [Steps in the way.] I apologize! He’s just hungry and irritable! That’s why he so rudely lashed out at an adult…[Mikasa checks on Eren.] I’m very sorry!

[The soldier realizes, he is now the source of attention.]

SOLDIER: Man...It’s ‘cause of us that you guys aren’t starving to death. You know! [Walks away.] Even you kids ougtha be thankful to us!

ARMIN: Of course!

EREN: Damn...I refuse to let them take care of me. [Eren sits on the building wall with Armin and Mikasa in front of him. ] I’m going back. To Wall Maria! I’m going to destroy every last Titan!

ARMIN: Eren...You’re not being serious, are you?

EREN: I’m serious! [Stands up in confidences and anger] I’m not like those guys who do nothing but act tough inside the walls. [Looks at the bread.] I don’t need this crap! [Tosses it towards Armin. Armin desperately juggles the bread to catch it.]

ARMIN: Eren! You’ll starve to death.

EREN: Doesn’t it bother you at all?! It’s because we take everyone’s charity that we can’t beat the Titans!

ARMIN: It’s impossible! There is no beating them! All we can do is live inside the walls! If we try anything, we’ll die! Just like my mom and dad!

EREN: So you’re just gonna grovel to them then?! That’s not shameful to you?!

ARMIN: [There’s… There’s nothing we can do for now!

EREN: That’s just an excuse! If you wanna live like livestock forever, go ahead! You wimp! [Mikasa jabs Eren right in his jaw and he falls to the ground.]

ARMIN: Mikasa…

MIKASA: If Armin’s a wimp, then so are we. Whether it was running from the Titans or fleeing the town, we didn’t manage anything on our own. We even had help finding food today. There’s no way such powerless people can defeat a single one of those Titans. Staying alive is what matters most. Just like your mother said. [Walks toward Eren and grabs the bread from Armin, and stuffs it into Eren’s mouth.]

ARMIN: Mikasa!

MIKASA: You have to eat and stay alive. I won’t let you starve to death. [Eren eats in shame, with tears building up in his eyes and cries.]

ARMIN: [Narrates.] Several days later, the throngs of refugees were tasked with cultivating the wastelands to secure food. However food shortage was unavoidable. So, in the following year of 846, the central government sent a multitude of refugees on a mission in the name of retaking Wall Maria. [Armin’s Grandfather puts leaves his hate as a memento for Armin on his head as he heads out. A gate opens.] Of the 250,000 sent, nearly 20% f the population, not even 200 survived. [Titans on the outside of the city walls are displayed in sunset.] Although it wasn’t much, their sacrifices did improve the food shortage situation for the rest of the population. [Sits and stares at his Grandfather’s hat, cries, and brings it close to his face. Eren and Mikasa are by his side.]

EREN: It’s all the Titan’s fault. If we could just subdue them. Our place in the world could be ours again. [Sits next to Armin.] Armin. I’m going to apply for the Cadets next year. I’m going to gain the strength to fight the Titans!

ARMIN: Me too…

EREN: [Surprised] Armin?!

ARMIN: Me too!

MIKASA: I will, too.

EREN: Mikasa…! You don’t need to! You said yourself staying alive is what’s important.

MIKASA: Yes. That’s why I”m doing it; so you won’t die.

EREN: [Stands up.] All right. The three of us, then.

[Scene switches to show kids with corps coats on.]

KEITH SADIES: The 104th Cadet Corps Class entrance ceremony will now begin! You have the misfortune of having me, Keith Sadies, as your commandant! I do not welcome you warmly! In your current state, you’d be nothing but food for the Titans! You’re mere livestock! You’re less than livestock! Over the next three years, we’re going to train you worthless nothings and teach you how to fight Titans! Three years from now, when you come face-to-face with the Titans, will you still be fodder for them?! Will you serve as an honorable barrier that protects the king?! Or will you be a glorious soldier for humanity that drives the Titans out?! It’s up to you to decide!

[EREN: [To himself.] Yes. I’ll be one. I’ll drive out every last Titan!
